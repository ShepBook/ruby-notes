##Conditional Statements

```
if <something is true>
  <some code to do>
else ##The if statement was false, so do this instead.
  <some other code to do>
end
```

You can also do ```elseif``` statements

```
if <something is true>
  <some code to do if true>
elseif <something else to test>
  <some other code to run>
elseif <another thing to test>
  <some more code to run if true>
end
```

**unless tests**

The opposite of ```if```

```
unless <test that returns false>
  <code to run if false>
else
  <code to run if true>
end
```

It is an alternative to the "if not" aka ```if !```
